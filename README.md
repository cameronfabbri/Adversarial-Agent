# Adversarial Agents
Using GANs to imitate someone playing GTAV.
Much of this code is from https://github.com/Sentdex/pygta5.

Currently I'm only using the code to grab the screen and send/record commands.

I'm modifying it to introduce new models based on adversarial networks.

Need to do this to write a pickle file that is usable in python2
pickle.dump(your_object, your_file, protocol=2)
