if there's data that you don't want (like if you pased
the game and the pause screen shows up), you can get rid of it
by just deleteting the images you don't want. This is because
the way data is fed into the network during training works by counting
the number of images, then randomly picks from them, and matches
up the actions by ID in a dictionary. So if the images aren't there,
then the actions in the pickle file will never be chosen.
